# Project_BankingSystem
 I developed a Banking System project in Python over the course of 2 hours. This is a simple, console-based application that runs in the Python IDE. The project does not include any database system or frontend work, focusing solely on basic banking functionalities such as account creation, balance checking, send money, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history.
